001: Hamming code
verifying the information by adding verify code (0/1) at desinated position

how much hamming code needed: 2**r >= m+r+1  (m=information length), (r= how many hamming code needed)
example : if you want to send a 16th information, then the hamming code was 
added at the position of  2**0, 2**1, 2**2....etc,(2**4=16, 2**5=32) so the total length will be 16+5+1

example: 1111 1111 1111 1111 (original)
